http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions

Criteria of hash function choice:
    collision rate
    avalanche characteristics (one bit change in input data should lead many bits change in output)
    hard to detect distribution of hash value   (cryptographic hash functions)
        Notice: random seed isn't enough


Choice:
    For security:   SipHash     (suppose to be replacement for Murmurhash)
    For speed:      SpookyHash on 64bit OS
                    Murmurhash on 32bit OS

==============================================

Fowler-Noll-Vo hash function    (bad quality)
    FNV-1
    FNV-1a (better avalanche characteristics)

Bob Jenkins hash function
    one-at-a-time
    SpookyHash          (fast, good quality)

MurmurHash2 (deprecated)        (vulnerable by hash DoS attack)
MurmurHash3                     (vulnerable by hash DoS attack)

CityHash    (base on Murmurhash)    (need CRC32 instructions in modern CPU,
                                     vulnerable by hash DoS attack,
                                     not maintain backward compatibility, not for persistent storage)

SipHash     (cryptographic hash function, safe and fast, not vulnerable by hash DoS attack)
