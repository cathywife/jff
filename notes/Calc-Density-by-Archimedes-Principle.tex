Have something A and something B, a stick and three strings, a cup of
water, we need to measure the density of B.

Steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   hang two things to the ends of the stick, adjust lift point
to reach balance, record length of two arms as $L_a^1$ and $L_b^1$.

    \item   let B immerge in water, repeat step above to get $L_a^2$ and $L_b^2$.
\end{itemize}

$\rho$ is the density of water, which is $1g/cm^3$.

\begin{eqnarray}
L_a^1 \rho_a V_a g & = & L_b^1 \rho_b V_b g \\
L_a^2 \rho_a V_a g & = & L_b^2 (\rho_b V_b g - \rho V_b g)
\end{eqnarray}

Then we get:
\begin{equation}
\rho_b = \frac{\rho}{1-\frac{L_a^2 L_b^1}{L_a^1 L_b^2}}
\end{equation}
