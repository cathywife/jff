<p>This document covers how the APR projects are versioned. Since the APR
projects are libraries, it is very important to define a stable API for users
of the libraries. However, we also need to move the libraries forward,
technologically. To balance these two needs, a strict policy of versioning is
required, which users can rely upon to understand the limitations,
restrictions, and the changes that can occur from one release of APR to the
next.</p>

<p>Minor releases can introduce new functions, new symbolic and enumerated
constants, and deprecate existing functions.</p>
<dl>
      <dt>New functions</dt>

      <dd><p>An application coded against an older minor release will still have
          all of its functions available with their original signatures. 
          Once an application begins to use a new function, however, they
          will be unable to work against older minor versions.</p>

          <p>It is tempting to say that introducing new functions might
          create incompatibility across minor releases. If an
          application takes advantage of an API that was introduced in
          version 2.3 of a library, then it is not going to work
          against version 2.2. However, we have stated that an any
          application built against version 2.2 will continue to work
          for all 2.x releases. Thus, an application that states
          "requires 2.3 or later" is perfectly acceptable -- the user
          or administrator simply upgrades the installed library to
          2.3. This is a safe operation and will not break any other
          application that was using the 2.2 library.</p>

          <p>In other words, yes an incompatibility arises by mandating
          that a specific version needs to be installed. But in
          practice, this will not be a problem since upgrading to
          newer versions is always safe.</p>
        </dd>

      <dt>New constants</dt>
      <dd>Similar to functions, all of the original (old) constants will be
          available to an application. An application can then choose to use
          new constants to pick up new semantics and features.</dd>

      <dt>Replacing functions</dt>
      <dd>This gets a bit trickier. The original function
          <strong>must</strong> remain available at the link-level so that an
          application compiled against a minor version will continue to work
          with later minor versions. Further, if an application is
          <em>designed</em> to work with an earlier minor version, then we
          don't want to suddenly change the requirements for that application.
          This means that the headers cannot silently map an old function
          into a newer function, as that would turn an application, say,
          based on 1.2 into an application requiring the 1.4 or later release.

          <p>This means that functions cannot truly be replaced. The new,
          alternate function can be made available in the header and
          applications can choose to use it (and become dependent upon
          the minor release where the function appears).</p>

          <p>It is possible to design a set of headers where a macro will
          always refer to the "latest" function available. Of course, if an
          application chooses to use this macro, then the resulting
          compiled-binary will be dependent upon whatever version it was
          compiled against.  This strategy adds the new functionality for
          applications, yet retains the necessary source and binary
          compatibility for applications designed or built against previous
          minor releases.</p>

          <p>Constants (enumerated values and preprocessor macros) are
          <strong>not</strong> allowed to change since an older application
          will still be using them. Similarly, function signatures at the
          link-level may not change, so that support for older, compiled
          applications is maintained.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Deprecating functions</dt>
      <dd>Since a function must remain available for applications coded
          against a previous minor release, it is only possible to
          "<em>deprecate</em>" a function. It <strong>cannot</strong> be
          removed from the headers (so that source compatibility is retained)
          and it cannot be removed from the library (so that binary
          compatibility is retained).

          <p>If you deprecate a function in APR, please mark it as such in the
          function documentation, using the doxygen "<code>\deprecated</code>"
          tag.  Deprecated functions can only be removed in major releases.</p>

          <p>A deprecated function should remain available <em>through</em>
          the original header. The function prototype should remain in the
          same header, or if moved to a "deprecated functions" header, then
          the alternate header should be included by the original header. This
          requirement is to ensure that source compatibility is retained.</p>

          <p>Finally, if you are deprecating a function so that you can change
          the name of the function, please use the method described above
          under "Replacing functions", so that projects which use APR can
          retain binary compatibility.</p>

          <p>Note that all deprecated functions will be removed at the next 
          major version bump.</p>

<p>The above symbols are the minimum required for this specification.</p>
<p>An application that desires, at compile-time, to decide on whether and how
to use a particular library feature needs to only check two values: the major
and the minor version. Since, by definition, there are no API changes across
patch versions, that symbol can be safely ignored. Note that any kind of a
check for a minimum version will then pin that application to at least that
version. The application's installation mechanism should then ensure that that
minimal version has been installed (for example, using RPM dependency checks).

  <blockquote>
<p>A library meeting this specification should support a way for an
application to determine the library's version at <em>run-time</em>. This will
usually be emboded as a simple function which returns the <tt>MAJOR</tt>,
<tt>MINOR</tt>, and <tt>PATCH</tt> triplet in some form.</p>
<p>Run-time checks are preferable in all cases. This type of check enables an
application to run against a wider variety of minor releases of a library (the
application is "<em>less coupled</em>" to a particular library release). Of
course, if an application requires a function that was introduced in a later,
minor release, then the application will require that, at least, that release
is installed on the target system.</p>
<p>Run-time checks are particurly important if the application is trying to
determine if the library has a particular bug that may need to be worked
around, but has been fixed in a later release. If the bug is fixed in a patch
release, then the only avenue for an application is to perform a runtime check.
This is because an application cannot require a specific patch level of the
library to be installed -- those libraries are perfectly forward and backwards
compatible, and the administrator is free to choose any patch release, knowing
that all applications will continue to function properly. If the bug was fixed
in a minor release, then it is possible to use a compile-time check, but that
would create a tighter coupling to the library. </p>

  <blockquote>
<p>On Unix-ish platforms, the library name should include the <tt>MAJOR</tt>
version number: </p>
<blockquote><tt>libFOO-MAJOR.so</tt></blockquote>
<p>This strategy allows an application to explicitly state which version
of the library that it wants to link against. If the application was built for
version 2 of the API, then it can link against <tt>libFOO-2.so</tt>. If another
application was built against version 3 of the API, then it links against
<tt>libFOO-3.so</tt>. Since both libraries can reside on the system at the same
time, both applications' needs can be satisfied.</p>
<p>Typically, shared libraries on Unix-ish platforms will set up symlinks from
the <tt>.so</tt> library to specific versions of that library. For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <tt>libFOO-MAJOR.so -&gt; libFOO-MAJOR.so.0<br />
      libFOO-MAJOR.so.0 -&gt; libFOO-MAJOR.so.0.MINOR.PATCH</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>In this configuration, applications will be bound to the <tt>.so.0</tt>
library. The minor version does not come into play here because we want
applications to dynamically load and link to the new library when a new minor
version is installed. Thus, the <tt>MINOR</tt> and the <tt>PATCH</tt> values
are relegated to the library name after the <tt>.so.0</tt> portion.</p>
<p>The implication here is that build systems for libraries should arrange
to generate <tt>.so</tt> libraries matching the above pattern.  </p>
