How to use:

1) Install Debian Wheezy base system, use host name "gold", domain
name "corp.example.com";

2) Use static network configuration in /etc/network/interfaces:

iface eth0 inet static
    address 10.0.0.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 10.0.0.1

Setup /etc/resolv.conf:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

If you don't use 10.0.0.10 for the "gold" server, adjust ./etc/bind/db.{corp,10}.

3) Run ./run.sh as root role, it may fail, fix errors and run ./run.sh
again until all are OK.

Add search line to /etc/resolv.conf:
search corp.example.com
nameserver 127.0.0.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
