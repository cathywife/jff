How to use:

1) Install Debian Wheezy base system, use host name "gold", domain
name "corp.example.com";

$ cat /etc/hostname
gold
$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	gold.corp.example.com	gold

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

2) Use static network configuration in /etc/network/interfaces:

iface eth0 inet static
    address 10.0.0.10
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 10.0.0.1

Setup /etc/resolv.conf:
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

If you don't use 10.0.0.10 for the "gold" server, adjust ./etc/bind/db.{corp,10}.

3) Run ./run.sh as root role, it may fail, fix errors and run ./run.sh
again until all are OK.

$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
search corp.example.com
nameserver 127.0.0.1
# for failover in case bind9 on 127.0.0.1 is not available
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
